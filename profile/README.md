## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ This organization is all about learning and collaborating. I want to learn how do manage an open source project/organization. The initial starting point of this project is to provide an environment to manage proxmox lxc (debian) containers declaratively.
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know? [Versioning](https://semver.org/) [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
🍿 This is a side project of me to do something fun - far away from work and kids.
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
