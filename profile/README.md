## Hi there, welcome to decldix 👋
🙋‍♀️ This organization is all about learning and collaborating. I want to learn how do manage an open source project/organization. 
The initial starting point of this project is to provide an environment to manage proxmox lxc (debian) containers declaratively.
I like the ideas of NixOS and I tinker a lot with it. For low ressource lxc containers on proxmox I like simple debian containers.
This project is intended to bring the advantages those solutions together.

👩‍💻 Useful resources: 
[Versioning](https://semver.org/) 
[Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)

🍿 This is a side project of me to do something fun - far away from day job and kids.
