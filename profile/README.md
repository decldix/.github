## Hi there, welcome to decldix 👋
🙋‍♀️ This organization is all about learning and collaborating. We want to learn how do manage an open source project/organization. 
The initial starting point of this project is to provide an environment to manage proxmox lxc (debian) containers declaratively.
We like the ideas of NixOS flakes. For low ressource lxc containers on proxmox we like simple debian containers.
This project is intended to bring the advantages those solutions together.

The name is an artificial word put together from
**decl**arative **d**ebian n**ix** as these are the driving principles behind this project idea.
